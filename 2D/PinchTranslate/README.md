#PinchTranslate

Requires library "LeapMotion for Processing" (author: Darius Morawiec)

Aim: Select and translate a ellipse with a pinch and move it to the targetArea. The programm takes the centroid of the thumb, index finger and middle finger as translation point. 

Press Space to start counting the time. Ending the pinch, time stops and writes the information in a data-file. 

Info: To make the DataPrinter work, closing with the X of the window is necessary (not the Processing stop-button!).
